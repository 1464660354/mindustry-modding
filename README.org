/Disclaimier: This is a work in progress, things may not work as expected./

* Overview
** Directory Structure

   At the root of your project you should have a ~content/~ directory, this is where all the JSON data goes, and in that directory you have other directories for various types of units, these are the current common ones:

   * ~content/items/~ for things like copper and surge-alloy,
   * ~content/blocks/~ for things like turrets and floors,
   * ~content/mechs/~ for player controlled mechs tau and dagger,
   * ~content/liquids/~ for liquids like water and slag,
   * ~content/units/~ for flying or ground units like reaper and dagger,
   * ~content/zones/~ for configuration of campaign maps.


** Dependencies

   You can add dependencies to your mod, and be able to have acces to them. Add the root directory name of the other mod, this in your ~mod.json~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "dependencies": [
        "other-mod-name",
        "not-a-mod"
    ]
}
#+END_SRC

   The names is the mods name lower cased, with special characters replaced with ~-~, and then from your mod, you can now use anything in the other mod by prefixing it with said name, for example:

   * ~other-mod-name-not-copper~ would referance ~not-copper~ in ~other-mod-name~,
   * ~other-mod-name-angry-dagger~ would referance ~angry-dagger~ in ~other-mod-name~,
   * ~not-a-mod-angry-dagger~ would referance ~angry-dagger~ in ~not-a-mod~.

* Type

  Feilds have noumerous attributes, but the important one is ~type~. Types /extend/ each other, and what that means is if ~MissileBulletType extends BasicBulletType~, then you'll have all the fields of ~BasicBulletType~ inside of ~MissileBulletType~ like ~damage~. A ~Turret~ type, is also a ~Block~ type, so it can also have ~health~, which is a ~Block~ field.

  Whether the behavior is what you'd expect is at the types discresion, some fields aren't actually really used by their extenders/childrens, resulting in no behavior at all. 

  A type can be specified in the field of an object, but this is not all a type is. A type is the type of something ~float~ is a type so ~0.3~ is type float. ~Block~ is a type, which isn't something you'll be using by itself, but instead you use ~Floor~ which is a ~Block~ type topped with behavior that is floor specific. 

  #+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
      "type": "Revenant",
          "weapon": { 
              "bullet": {
                  "type": "MissileBulletType",
              "damage": 9000
          }
      }
  }
  #+END_SRC

Here you can see, the type of the top level object is `Revenant`, but the type of the `bullet` which needs to be a `BulletType` is actually `MissileBulletType`, which gives you attributes, behaviors and effects that missiles should have.

** UnlockableContent and MappableContent 

   Types that can have a display name and description. /Most content in other words/ but not everything. `ItemStack` isn't `UnlockableContent` because it's not content, it's just a stack of items.

   | field       | type   |
   |-------------+--------|
   | name        | String |
   | description | String |
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC json
   {
       "type": "Revenant",
       "name": "Mammoth",
       "description": "Not a description."
   }
   #+END_SRC

** ItemStack

    This type is used by blocks, to consume/output items. 

    An item stack is simply an array of objects with these fields:

    | field  | type | default |
    |--------+------+---------|
    | amount | int  |       1 |
    | item   | Item |         |

    For example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC json
 [
     { "amount": 30, "item": "surge-alloy" },
     { "amount": 90, "item": "copper" }
 ]
 #+END_SRC

** LiquidStack

   This type is used by blocks, to consume a liquid, just like `ItemStack` except that it can only contain 1 liquid.

   | field  | type   |
   |--------+--------|
   | liquid | Liquid |
   | amount | float  |

   For example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
   "liquid": "water",
   "amount": 0.5
}
   #+END_SRC

** Attributes

   Used inside of `Foor` type, to give a tile attributes, like `heat`. This is an object with an array of attributes, with specific attribute values at each index.

    * index ~0~ is ~heat~,
    * index ~1~ is ~spores~,
    * index ~2~ is ~water~,
    * indeb ~3~ is ~oil~.

    For example, this would give you ~100~ heat, ~1~ spores, ~0.5~ water and ~0.1~ oil.

    #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "array": [ 100, 1, 0.5, 0.1]
}
    #+END_SRC

    You could use it inside of `Floor` type as such:

    #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "type": "Floor",
    "name": "magma",
    "attributes": { "array": [ 0.75, 0, 0, 0 ] }
}
    #+END_SRC
