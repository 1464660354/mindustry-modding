/Disclaimier: This is a work in progress, things may not work as expected./

* Overview
** Directory Structure

   At the root of your project you should have a ~content/~ directory, this is where all the JSON data goes, and in that directory you have other directories for various types of units, these are the current common ones:

   * ~content/items/~ for things like copper and surge-alloy,
   * ~content/blocks/~ for things like turrets and floors,
   * ~content/mechs/~ for player controlled mechs tau and dagger,
   * ~content/liquids/~ for liquids like water and slag,
   * ~content/units/~ for flying or ground units like reaper and dagger,
   * ~content/zones/~ for configuration of campaign maps.

   Feilds have noumerous attributes, but the important one is ~type~ as it's what tells the parser which class of object to select. A lot of objects are actually very simple, and follow the common OOP patterns, all that means is they inherit attributes and various behaviors. *(sometimes predictably, othertimes not as much)*

** Dependencies

   You can add dependencies to your mod, and be able to have acces to them. Add the root directory name of the other mod, this in your ~mod.json~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "dependencies": [
        "other-mod-name",
        "not-a-mod"
    ]
}
#+END_SRC

   The names is the mods name lower cased, with special characters replaced with ~-~, and then from your mod, you can now use anything in the other mod by prefixing it with said name, for example:

   * ~other-mod-name-not-copper~ would referance ~not-copper~ in ~other-mod-name~,
   * ~other-mod-name-angry-dagger~ would referance ~angry-dagger~ in ~other-mod-name~,
   * ~not-a-mod-angry-dagger~ would referance ~angry-dagger~ in ~not-a-mod~.

** Inheritance

   You may be confused as to what `extends` mean. In the context of modding, all it means is some fields are inherited. A `Turret` type, is also a `Block` type, so it can also have `health` which happens to be in `Block` because it `extends Block`. 

   Whether the behavior is what you'd expect is at the objects discresion, some fields aren't actually really used by their extenders, resulting in no behavior at all.

** ItemStack

   This type is used by blocks, to consume/output items. 

   An item stack is simply an array of objects with these fields:

   | field  | type | default |
   |--------+------+---------|
   | amount | int  |       1 |
   | item   | Item |         |

   For example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
[
    { "amount": 30, "item": "surge-alloy" },
    { "amount": 90, "item": "copper" }
]
#+END_SRC

** LiquidStack

   This type is used by blocks, to consume a liquid, just like `ItemStack` except that it can only contain 1 liquid.

   | field  | type   |
   |--------+--------|
   | liquid | Liquid |
   | amount | float  |

   For example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC json
{
   "liquid": "water",
   "amount": 0.5
}
   #+END_SRC

** UnlockableContent and MappableContent 

   This is for types that can have a display name and description.

   | field       | type   |
   |-------------+--------|
   | name        | String |
   | description | String |
